# backbone rails api appliction that I learned from
Basically we are using rails as an api to serve JSON
our application. Backbone takes care of the routing
and templating is basically what you want to use.

This is my favorite kind of application to build because
it's a great user experience and it's not "the norm"
or at least not yet. More and more developers are using
an isomorphic kind of application where the backend code
produces basically the same code as the client.
